Just a blogging website created by me as a project to practicing Django.It was made using Python 3.6 + Django and database is SQLite. Bootstrap was used for styling.

Helper Tools

It is possible to add additional admin user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:

$ python manage.py createsuperuser

Enter your desired username and press enter.

Username: admin_username

You will then be prompted for your desired email address:

Email address: admin@example.com

The final step is to enter your password. You will be asked to enter your password twice, the second time as a confirmation of the first.

Password: **********
Password (again): *********
